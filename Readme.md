# Final Project: Video Hosting Backend

This project is the final assignment for our course, where we built a backend for a video hosting platform like YouTube. It is created using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. Key features include:

- **User Authentication**: Login and signup with **JWT** and **bcrypt**.  
- **Video Features**: Upload, like, dislike, comment, and reply.  
- **Subscriptions**: Subscribe and unsubscribe to channels.  
- **Secure Access**: Uses access and refresh tokens.  

This project follows good coding practices and provides a complete backend experience. It was a great way to learn and apply backend development skills.
