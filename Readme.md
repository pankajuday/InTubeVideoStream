# Final Project: Video Hosting Backend

This project is the culmination of our course, showcasing a comprehensive backend for a YouTube-like video hosting platform. Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**, it incorporates essential backend functionalities, including:

- **User Authentication**: Login and signup using **JWT** and **bcrypt**.  
- **Video Management**: Upload, like, dislike, comment, and reply.  
- **Subscription System**: Subscribe and unsubscribe to channels.  
- **Secure Access**: Utilizes access and refresh tokens for enhanced security.  

We followed industry-standard practices, ensuring a robust and scalable backend. Completing this project provided hands-on experience with modern backend technologies and best practices, making it a valuable learning milestone.
